GitOps (Declarative Application Deployment)
Use Case Example:
A company manages Kubernetes applications manually using kubectl apply. This leads to configuration drift between environments. Using GitOps, they define application state declaratively in a Git repository, allowing automated synchronization to Kubernetes.

Security & DevOps Considerations:
Security: Protect the Git repository, enforce branch protection, and scan YAML configurations for vulnerabilities.
DevOps: Use ArgoCD or Flux to automatically sync Kubernetes manifests with the cluster.
Assorted Code Example:
Example: Deploying an application using ArgoCD.

Define Kubernetes manifest (app-deployment.yaml):
