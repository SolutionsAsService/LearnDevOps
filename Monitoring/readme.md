# Observability & Monitoring

Use Case Example:
A companyâ€™s production servers experience performance issues, but engineers lack visibility into logs and metrics. By implementing centralized logging and monitoring, they can detect and troubleshoot issues in real time.

#### Without monitoring, debugging production issues is difficult. Observability tools like Prometheus help track logs, performance, and errors in real time.

## Security & DevOps Considerations:

Security Considerations
Access Control: Restrict Prometheus metrics endpoint to internal use only.
Data Encryption: Use TLS for secure transmission of logs.
Anomaly Detection: Set up alerts for unusual traffic spikes.

DevOps Considerations
Grafana Dashboards: Visualize CPU, memory, and API request trends.
Alerting: Send alerts via Slack or PagerDuty when an issue is detected.
