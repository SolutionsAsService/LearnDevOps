Observability & Monitoring
Use Case Example:
A companyâ€™s production servers experience performance issues, but engineers lack visibility into logs and metrics. By implementing centralized logging and monitoring, they can detect and troubleshoot issues in real time.

Security & DevOps Considerations:
Security: Restrict log access, mask sensitive data in logs, and enable encrypted data transport.
DevOps: Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and monitoring.
Assorted Code Example:
Example: Setting up Prometheus monitoring for a Node.js application.
