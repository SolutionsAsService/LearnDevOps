Imagine an e‑commerce platform where different business functions are separated into independent services. For instance, there might be a user authentication service, product catalog service, order management service, and payment processing service. Each of these microservices can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. They communicate via RESTful APIs (or messaging queues) and are often containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.

Security & DevOps Considerations:

Security: Secure API gateways, mutual TLS, and OAuth are used to protect inter‑service communication.
DevOps: CI/CD pipelines deploy each microservice independently, while monitoring and logging tools ensure visibility.
