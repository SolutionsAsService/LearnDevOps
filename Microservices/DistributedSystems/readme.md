Distributed Systems
Use Case Example:
Consider a real‑time analytics platform that processes high‑volume data streams from IoT devices. A distributed system could use Apache Kafka for ingesting streams, Apache Spark for processing, and a distributed database for storing results. Each component runs on separate nodes, communicating over the network.

Security & DevOps Considerations:

Security: Encrypt data in transit (using TLS) between nodes and use strict access controls.
DevOps: Automation for provisioning clusters, centralized logging, and monitoring (e.g., with Prometheus and Grafana) are essential.
Assorted Code Example:

Example: A simple distributed task using Python Celery with Redis as a broker
