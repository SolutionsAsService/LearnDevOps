# Serverless Applications

## Use Case Example:
A serverless web application might use AWS Lambda functions triggered by HTTP requests through API Gateway. For instance, a photo-sharing app could use Lambda to process uploaded images (resize, watermark, etc.) and store them in Amazon S3. This model scales automatically with demand and you pay only for the compute time used.

## Security & DevOps Considerations:

Security: Leverage IAM roles to limit what each function can access and use API Gateway to enforce request validation and throttling.
DevOps: Serverless deployments are typically integrated with CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring is handled via CloudWatch Logs and AWS X-Ray.
Assorted Code Example:

## Components: 
A simple AWS Lambda function in Python (handler.py)

A simple AWS Lambda function in Python (handler.py)

A simple AWS SAM template (template.yaml) to deploy the Lambda function via AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
