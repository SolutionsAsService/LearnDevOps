# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Use Case Example:
Imagine a company managing cloud infrastructure manually. Every time a new server is needed, an engineer provisions it via the cloud console. This process is time-consuming and error-prone. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure provisioning using declarative code, ensuring consistency, scalability, and repeatability.

A common tool for this is Terraform, which allows you to define infrastructure in a human-readable format and apply changes with version control.

### Manually provisioning cloud infrastructure is slow and prone to errors. IaC automates infrastructure deployment using code, ensuring consistency across environments.

## Security Considerations

##### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Restricts infrastructure changes to authorized users.
##### Secrets Management: Store Terraform state files securely in AWS S3 with encryption.
##### State Locking: Use DynamoDB state locking to prevent simultaneous deployments.

## DevOps Considerations

#### CI/CD Integration: Automate infrastructure changes using GitHub Actions.
#### Terraform Workspaces: Manage multiple environments (dev, staging, production) separately.
