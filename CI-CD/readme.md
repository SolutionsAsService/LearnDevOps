# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Use Case Example:

A team developing a web application manually deploys code to production, leading to inconsistent deployments and frequent errors. A CI/CD pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application, reducing downtime and increasing reliability.

## Manually deploying applications leads to inconsistent releases and errors. CI/CD automates testing and deployment, ensuring reliability.

## Security & DevOps Considerations:
Security: Store secrets securely (e.g., GitHub Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager). Scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
DevOps: Automate testing and deployments using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD.
Assorted Code Example:
Example: A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Python Flask app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
