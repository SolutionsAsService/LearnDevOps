# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Use Case Example:

A team developing a web application manually deploys code to production, leading to inconsistent deployments and frequent errors. A CI/CD pipeline automates building, testing, and deploying the application, reducing downtime and increasing reliability.

## Manually deploying applications leads to inconsistent releases and errors. CI/CD automates testing and deployment, ensuring reliability.

## Security & DevOps Considerations:

Security Considerations
Secrets Management: Store AWS credentials securely using GitHub Secrets.
Dependency Scanning: Use tools like Snyk to detect vulnerabilities in dependencies.
Branch Protection Rules: Require code reviews before merging changes.

DevOps Considerations
Automated Testing: CI/CD ensures only tested code is deployed.
Rollback Strategy: Enable rollback to a previous stable release in case of failure.
